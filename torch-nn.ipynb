You want a breakdown of the most commonly used parts of the `torch.nn` library, focusing on the components that are practical for everyday deep learning projects. Here's a curated list based on typical usage patterns:\n\n**1. Building Blocks (Modules):**\n\n*   **`nn.Module`:**  The foundation.

Core Layers:**\n\n*   **`nn.Linear`:**  Your standard fully connected layer. Essential for most neural networks.\n*   **`nn.Conv2d`:**  The workhorse for image-related tasks (convolutional layer).\n*   **`nn.MaxPool2d`:**  Commonly used after `Conv2d` for downsampling feature maps in image tasks.\n*   **`nn.ReLU`:**  The most popular activation function. Simple, yet effective.\n*   **`nn.Sigmoid`:** Used in the output layer for binary classification problems to produce probabilities between 0 and 1.\n*   **`nn.Softmax`:** Used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems to produce probability distributions.\n\n**3.
